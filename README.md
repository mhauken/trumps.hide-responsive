# Hide-responsive
This is an extension to the exellent CSS-framework [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/)

`hide-responsive` loops through the breakpoints defined in `settings.responsive` to generate prefixed breakpoint-based classes that you can use to hide content on specific breakpoints. If you are using inuitcssâ€™ default breakpoints, you will be given classes like lap-and-up-hide, or desk-hide, etc.
